Constraints = """See the Image will be of Consisting of individual blocks (chip floorplan), We can extract the total area and the 
 total area covered by all the individual blocks their dimensions and the total percentage that it covers of the whole Image  which is provided in the image description 
There are some Constraints which will be while generating layouts :
**Hard Constraints (MUST FOLLOW):**


1. Block Area Preservation: The area of each individual block must remain exactly the same as in the original layout.
2.The area of the blocks should remain constant, the aspect ratio can change however according to the adjacent block arrangements.
3. Complete Coverage: All blocks must fit precisely within the chip boundaries with no gaps or overlaps between any blocks.
4. There should be NO OVERLAPS between the blocks in the generated layouts.
5. Maintain the same and Consistent color coding throughout the generated layouts.
6. Aspect Ratio Limits: When modifying block shapes, aspect ratios should not change by more than 2:1 from original.
7. Physical Feasibility: Generated layouts must represent physically realizable chip designs.
8.All the rearrangend blocks should be properly arranged and should be properly separated from each other.
9 ALL the blocks should be fitted properly in the layout and should not be outside the layout.
